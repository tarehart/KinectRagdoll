Kinect Ragdoll
==============

This program lets you control a 2D ragdoll using a Kinect. I might develop it into an
obstacle course / time trial type of game, plus just a physics sandbox.


How to play
-----------
1. Launch the game
2. Follow this sequence:
	- Stand back from your Kinect, the background turns green.
	- Raise your hands like a referee signaling a field goal, the background turns yellow.
	- Hold that pose for a few seconds, the background turns beige and you now control the ragdoll.
3. Put your chest out and head back to fire thrusters out of your hands and feet
4. There's currently no object to the game.



Adding Physics Props
--------------------
- Press 'R' to open the rectangle form, then fill it out. Hold 'Shift' and click on the game screen to place a rectangle.
- Press 'P' to open the properties form. Use it to modify the physics properties of objects.



Tips
-----------
- You will go limp for a while if you take a hard hit to the head.
- If you've fallen and you can't get up, try putting your hands above your head and then swinging them down to your sides.
- The thrusters get stronger the more you lean your head back. The game compares the position of your head to your 'torso'.
- The game gently tries to rotate the ragdoll so that it's leaning at the same angle you are.
- One player at a time for now.


To Do
-----------
- Decent sandbox editing / saving / loading
- Some kind of objective mode
- Alternative things to control (tank?)
