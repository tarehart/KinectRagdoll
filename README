Kinect Ragdoll
==============

This program lets you control a 2D ragdoll using a Kinect. I might develop it into an
obstacle course / time trial type of game, plus just a physics sandbox. Windows only.


How to play
-----------
1. Download and install the Kinect for Windows SDK (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/kinectsdk/download.aspx)
2. Plug in a Kinect
3. Launch the game
4. Put your chest out and head back to fire thrusters out of your hands and feet
5. Punch your hands up, down, and to the sides to shoot bullets
6. There's currently no object to the game.



Adding Physics Props
--------------------
Use the toolbar at the top. Click one of the icons to start using the tool.
- Pointer tool: drag on background to select objects, drag on object to move it.
- Rectangle tool: drag to create a rectangle
- Nail tool: click to add a nail that pivots an object on the background
- Joint tool: click to add a joint between two objects.

Note: nails and joints can be turned into motors via the property editor.


Making Selections
-----------------
Select the pointer tool and drag a rectangle to make a selection. The selected objects will turn yellow and appear listed in the selection editor.

You can modify your selection with the checkboxes in the selection editor, and perform various operations on the selected objects.


Using the Property Editor
-------------------------
The property editor can change the attributes of any physics object. To begin editing an object, you must highlight it in red by either right-clicking it or choosing edit from the selection editor.

You can navigate to other objects within the property editor by highlighting an object and clicking "Go to selected".


Tips
-----------
- You will go limp for a while if you take a hard hit to the head.
- If you've fallen and you can't get up, try putting your hands above your head and then swinging them down to your sides.
- The thrusters get stronger the more you lean your head back. The game compares the position of your head to your 'torso'.
- The game gently tries to rotate the ragdoll so that it's leaning at the same angle you are.
- One player at a time for now.


To Do
-----------
- Objectives
- Equipment/powerups
- Sounds
- Alternative things to control (tank?)
